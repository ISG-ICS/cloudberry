## Build

Prerequisites: scala, sbt, [AsterixDB](http://asterixdb.apache.org)

### Prepare the AsterixDB cluster
Option 1: Follow the official [documentation](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/install.html) to setup a fully functional cluster.

Option 2: Use the prebuilt AsterixDB docker image to run a small test cluster locally.
This approach serves the debug purpose.

Assume you've already had docker(>1.10) installed on your local machine,
you can simply run the following command to create an AsterixDB cluster locally.

```
> ./script/dockerRunAsterixDB.sh  
```

### To compile projects
```
> cd cloudberry
> sbt compile
```

### Run Cloudberry service
You will need to give the AsterixDB cluster link to `neo` by change the `asterixdb.url` configuration in `neo/conf/application.conf` file.
The default value points to the localhost docker cluster
```
> sbt "project neo" "run"
```

### Run TwitterMap demo
TwitterMap is a demonstration application that shows how front-end services communicate with Cloudberry.
You can run the following command in a separate command line window.
```
> cd examples/twittermap
> ./script/ingestAllTwitterToLocalCluster.sh
> sbt "project web" "run 9001"
```
You should see the TwitterMap demo on [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

## Deploy Cloudberry
Use `sbt dist` to make a Cloudberry package as follows:
```
> sbt "project neo" "clean" "dist"
```

There should be one zip file called `neo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip` generated under `cloudberry/neo/target/universal/`. 

You can copy the file to where you want to run the Cloudberry, unzip it, and run the instance in the background as follows:
```
> cd neo-1.0-SNAPSHOT
> bin/neo -Dapplication.secret='Yf]0bsdO2ckhJd]^sQ^IPISElBrfy<XWdTWukRwJK8KKc3rFG>Cn;nnaX:N/=R1<' -Dconfig.file=/full/path/to/production.conf  &
```

The `application.secret` value should be the same as the one in the application.conf when you run the `sbt dist` command. You can find more in the Play! framework [documentation page](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/Deploying)

When it runs, there will be one `RUNNING_PID` file generated that includes the PID of the instance. You can kill the corresponding process to stop the instance. 

You can run the *TwitterMap* application in the same way by running the following command:
```
> cd examples/twittermap
> sbt "project web" "clean" "dist"
```
, and run the server on a different port `9001`: 
```
> cd web-1.0-SNAPSHOT
> bin/web -Dapplication.secret='Yf]0bsdO2ckhJd]^sQ^IPISElBrfy<XWdTWukRwJK8KKc3rFG>Cn;nnaX:N/=R1<' -Dconfig.file=/full/path/to/production.conf -Dhttp.port=9001 &
```
