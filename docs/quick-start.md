## 1. Setup TwitterMap Using Cloudberry and AsterixDB

This page includes instructions on how to use Cloudberry and AsterixDB to setup a small instance of the
[TwitterMap](http://cloudberry.ics.uci.edu/demos/twittermap/) on a local machine. 
The following diagram illustrates its architecture: ![architecture][architecture]

System requirements:

 - Linux or Mac
 - At least 4GB memory

**Step 1**: Follow the instructions on this [`page`](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html) to install `sbt`.

**Step 2**: Clone the Cloudberry codebase from github.

```
~> git clone https://github.com/ISG-ICS/cloudberry.git
```

Suppose the repostory is cloned to the folder `~/cloudberry`.

**Step 3**: Use the following steps to start a Docker container that has a pre-built AsterixDB cluster.

   1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) (version at least 1.10) on the local machine;
   2. Run the following commands:

```
~> cd cloudberry
~/cloudberry> ./script/dockerRunAsterixDB.sh
```
The second command will download and run a prebuilt AsterixDB docker container from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jianfeng/asterixdb/). This step may take 5-10 minutes or even longer, depending on your network speed.
After it finishes, you should see the messages as shown in the following screenshot:
![docker][docker]

**Step 4**: Run the following command to ingest sample tweets (about 47K) and US population data into AsterixDB.


```
~/cloudberry> ./script/ingestAllTwitterToLocalCluster.sh
```

When it finishes you should see the messages as shown in the following screenshot:
![ingestion][ingestion]

**Step 5**: Compile and run the Cloudberry server.

```
~/cloudberry> sbt compile
~/cloudberry> sbt "project neo" "run"
```

Wait until the shell prints the messages shown in the following screenshot:
![neo][neo]

**Step 6**: Start the TwitterMap Web server (in port 9001) by running the following command in another shell:

```
~/cloudberry> sbt "project twittermap" "run 9001"
```

Wait until the shell prints the messages shown in the following screenshot:
![twittermap][twittermap]


**Step 7**: Open a browser to access [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) to see the TwitterMap frontend.  The first time you open the page, it could take up to several minutes (depending on your machine's speed) to show the following Web page:
![web][web]


**Congratulations!** You have successfully set up TwitterMap using Cloudberry and AsterixDB!

## Setup your own AsterixDB cluster 

The instructions above assume that we use an AsterixDB instance in a Docker container. If you want to setup your AsterixDB cluster, please use the following steps.

**Step 8**: Follow the instructions on the [AsterixDB Installation Guide](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/index.html) to install an AsterixDB cluster.  Select your preferred installation option. 

**Step 9**: Ingest twitter data to AsterixDB

You need to give the RESTFul API link of the AsterixDB cluster and one of its NC names to the ingestion script as following:

```bash
~/cloudberry> ./script/ingestAllTwitterToLocalCluster.sh http://YourAsterixDBServerIP:19002/aql ONE_OF_NC_NAMES
```

**Step 10**: Change the Cloudberry middleware configuration to connect to this new AsterixDB cluster. 
You can modify the AsterixDB hostname in the configuration file `neo/conf/application.conf` by changing the `asterixdb.url` value.

```properties
asterixdb.url = "http://YourAsterixDBHostName:19002/query/service"
```

## 2. Under the Hood

Next we explain the details of the TwitterMap.

### 2.1 Create a Dataset in AsterixDB

In Step 9, we ran a script called `./script/ingestAllTwitterToLocalCluster.sh` to create data sets in AsterixDB and ingest data into them. 
The following are the executed DDL statements.
 

```
create dataverse twitter if not exists;
use dataverse twitter
create type typeUser if not exists as open {
    id: int64,
    name: string,
    screen_name : string,
    lang : string,
    location: string,
    create_at: date,
    description: string,
    followers_count: int32,
    friends_count: int32,
    statues_count: int64
}
create type typePlace if not exists as open{
    country : string,
    country_code : string,
    full_name : string,
    id : string,
    name : string,
    place_type : string,
    bounding_box : rectangle
}
create type typeGeoTag if not exists as open {
    stateID: int32,
    stateName: string,
    countyID: int32,
    countyName: string,
    cityID: int32?,
    cityName: string?
}
create type typeTweet if not exists as open{
    create_at : datetime,
    id: int64,
    "text": string,
    in_reply_to_status : int64,
    in_reply_to_user : int64,
    favorite_count : int64,
    coordinate: point?,
    retweet_count : int64,
    lang : string,
    is_retweet: boolean,
    hashtags : {{ string }} ?,
    user_mentions : {{ int64 }} ? ,
    user : typeUser,
    place : typePlace?,
    geo_tag: typeGeoTag
}
create dataset ds_tweet(typeTweet) if not exists primary key id 
using compaction policy prefix (("max-mergable-component-size"="134217728"),("max-tolerance-component-count"="10")) with filter on create_at ;
create index text_idx if not exists on ds_tweet("text") type fulltext;
```

Read this [page](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/sqlpp/primer-sqlpp.html) about the details.

The script uses a feature called `Feed` to ingest tweets into AsterixDB. The following statements create
a feed called `TweetFeed`:

```
create feed TweetFeed using socket_adapter
(
    ("sockets"="$nc:10001"),
    ("address-type"="nc"),
    ("type-name"="typeTweet"),
    ("format"="adm")
);
connect feed TweetFeed to dataset ds_tweet;
start feed TweetFeed;
```

The following shell command ingests the data from a local file with tweets into AsterixDB using the defined `TweetFeed`:


```bash
gunzip -c ./script/sample.adm.gz | ./script/fileFeed.sh $host 10001
```

For more information about AsterixDB data feed, please refer to this [page](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/feeds/tutorial.html).

### 2.2 Setup Cloudberry

In Step 10, we changed the configuration file of Cloudberry by providing the information about the
AsterixDB instance.

### 2.3 Setup TwitterMap Web Server

The TwitterMap Web application uses the [Play Framework](http://playframework.com) to talk to the Cloudberry service. The configuration
of the framework is in the file `twittermap/conf/application.conf`.  In the file, the `cloudberry.register` property specifies the 
HTTP API of Cloudberry:

```properties
cloudberry.register = "http://CLOUDBERRY-HOST-NAME:CLOUDBERRY-PORT/admin/register"
```

When the TwitterMap server starts, it will run `controllers/TwitterMapApplication.scala`, which will run 
`twittermap/app/model/Migration_20170428.scala`. This script registers four data sets to the Cloudberry server.
They are:

* twitter.ds_tweet
* twitter.dsStatePopulation
* twitter.dsCountyPopulation
* twitter.dsCityPopulation

Cloudberry will talk to AsterixDB to collect information about these data sets. Take the data set `twitter.ds_tweet` as an example.   The script sends the following DDL request to Cloudberry to register the information about this data set in AsterixDB.

```JSON
{
  "dataset":"twitter.ds_tweet",
  "schema":{
  	"typeName":"twitter.typeTweet",
    "dimension":[
      {"name":"create_at","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Time"},
      {"name":"id","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"coordinate","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Point"},
      {"name":"lang","isOptional":false,"datatype":"String"},
      {"name":"is_retweet","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Boolean"},
      {"name":"hashtags","isOptional":true,"datatype":"Bag","innerType":"String"},
      {"name":"user_mentions","isOptional":true,"datatype":"Bag","innerType":"Number"},
      {"name":"user.id","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"geo_tag.stateID","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"geo_tag.countyID","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"geo_tag.cityID","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"geo","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Hierarchy","innerType":"Number",
        "levels":[
          {"level":"state","field":"geo_tag.stateID"},
          {"level":"county","field":"geo_tag.countyID"},
          {"level":"city","field":"geo_tag.cityID"}]}
    ],
    "measurement":[
      {"name":"text","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Text"},
      {"name":"in_reply_to_status","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"in_reply_to_user","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"favorite_count","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"retweet_count","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"},
      {"name":"user.status_count","isOptional":false,"datatype":"Number"}
    ],
    "primaryKey":["id"],
    "timeField":"create_at"
  }
}
```

In the configuration file, the `cloudberry.ws` property tells the front-end the Web socket address of the Cloudbery server. 

```properties
cloudberry.ws = "ws://CLOUDBERRY_HOST_NAME:CLOUDBERRY_PORT/ws"
```

The frontend uses the web socket to communicate with the Cloudberry server directly. The corresponding logic can be found in `twittermap/public/javascripts/common/services.js` file.

For more information about how to write registration DDL and Cloudberry request please refer to this [page](/documentation).

## 3. Build your own application

TwitterMap is one example of how to use Cloudberry. To develop your own application, you can do the following steps:

1. Use AsterixDB to create your own data sets; 
2. Give the link of the AsterixDB instance to Cloudberry by following step 10;
3. Register the necessary datasets into Cloudberry as in Section 2.3;
4. Set up the Web socket connection between the front-end web page and the Cloudberry server as in Section 2.3;
5. Define your queries and responses as in `twittermap/public/javascripts/common/services.js`.
